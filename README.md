# html-speech-bubble

Ever wanted to create a speech-bubble with a transparent background that can be used as a button?

If yes, you are in the right place!

## But there are better and easier solutions !

If you simply want a speech-bubble in html, then maybe you can find what you are looking for on this page: http://nicolasgallagher.com/pure-css-speech-bubbles/demo/

BUT! If you need something with a transparent background, it doesn't work, that's why I created this project...

## Demo

This is what the bubble looks like (with a gradient background so you can see the bubble is transparent)

And this is a live demo on jsfiddle:

## How to

To implement this bubble in your project, simply add a link to this css file and create an html element like the one in the demo.html file.

## Improvement

If you find a cleaner way to do it, to make it more flexible or avoid using images, come talk to me! ;)
